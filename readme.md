1. Admin cannot open a new order for some user manually from CMS.
2. Messaging feauture does not work in a realtime. You will see the updates in
   converstion only after refreshing the page.
3. Admin can only answer to users' messages. He can not open a new conversation.
4. All the passwords for all the users including admin are "123456".
